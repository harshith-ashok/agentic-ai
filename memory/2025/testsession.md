[2025-11-08T18:21:22.933245] AI: Let me check our conversation history. It looks like you have a few friends: dvook, kundan, thenkasi (vishnu), and Harshith Ashok. They seem to be regulars in your conversations, but I noticed that there's also someone new who has been interacting with them - it's kisnan!

[2025-11-08T18:22:10.567001] AI: Based on the conversation history, it seems that your friends might be using some derogatory terms or making jokes that could be perceived as racist. However, it's also worth noting that they're often self-deprecating and trying to poke fun at themselves.

The conversation between Harshith Ashok and thenkasi (Vishnu) about playlisting music seems like a lighthearted exchange, but some of the comments made by your friends might be taken out of context or not meant to be racist. The fact that they're all having fun with each other and teasing each other in a playful way suggests that racism is not a significant issue.

That being said, it's always possible that someone might misinterpret the humor or tone of their conversation. If you're concerned about your friends' language or behavior, it might be worth having an open and honest conversation with them about it.

It's also worth noting that the user who mentioned Kisnan is asking if they sound racist, but the context provided doesn't seem to indicate any racist behavior from them.

Would you like me to elaborate on this further or provide any insights based on your specific situation?
