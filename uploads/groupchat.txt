[10/08/25, 7:25:30 PM] kisnan: Both Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have impressive stats, but here's a comparison to help determine who's considered the GOAT (Greatest of All Time):
- *Total Career Goals*: Cristiano Ronaldo leads with 938 goals, while Messi has 874 goals.
- *Goals Per Game*: Messi averages 0.83 goals per game, surpassing Ronaldo's 0.74 goals per game.
- *Assists*: Messi has 388 assists in 1116 career appearances, compared to Ronaldo's 257 assists in 1281 games.
- *Free Kick Goals*: Messi has scored 69 free kick goals, slightly edging Ronaldo's 64 free kick goals.
- *Penalties*: Ronaldo has scored 175 penalties, while Messi has scored 110 penalties.
- *Aerial Duels*: Ronaldo dominates this category, winning 1042 aerial duels compared to Messi's 162.
- *Dribbling*: Messi excels at dribbling, completing 3,751 successful dribbles, while Ronaldo has 1,845.

Some notable records ¹ ²:
- *Most goals scored in La Liga*: Messi holds the record with 474 goals.
- *Most appearances in La Liga*: Messi has 520 appearances.
- *Champions League Records*: Ronaldo holds multiple records, including most goals.

Ultimately, determining the GOAT depends on individual perspectives and weight given to different statistics. Both Messi and Ronaldo have achieved incredible success and have their own strengths ³.

[09/10/25, 9:24:09 PM] kisnan: @⁨Meta AI⁩ why is fish oil capsules used
[09/10/25, 9:24:11 PM] Meta AI: Fish oil capsules are dietary supplements that contain omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid). These essential fatty acids are found in fatty fish and have been shown to have numerous health benefits.

## Uses of Fish Oil Capsules
1. *Heart Health*: Omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil capsules may help lower triglycerides, reduce blood pressure, and prevent blood clots, all of which can contribute to a reduced risk of heart disease.
2. *Inflammation Reduction*: Omega-3s have anti-inflammatory properties, which may help alleviate symptoms of conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and other inflammatory diseases.
3. *Brain Function and Development*: DHA is important for brain function and development, and some studies suggest that fish oil supplements may help improve cognitive function, memory, and focus.
4. *Mental Health*: Omega-3s may have a positive effect on depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder, although more research is needed to confirm these findings.
5. *Pregnancy and Fetal Development*: DHA is essential for fetal brain and eye development during pregnancy, and fish oil supplements may help support healthy fetal development.

## Precautions and Interactions
1. *Consult a Doctor*: Before taking fish oil capsules, especially if you have underlying medical conditions, take medications, or are pregnant/breastfeeding.
2. *Quality and Purity*: Choose high-quality fish oil supplements that are purified and tested for contaminants like mercury and PCBs.
3. *Interactions with Medications*: Fish oil may interact with certain medications, such as blood thinners, so it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional.

Overall, fish oil capsules can be a beneficial supplement for those who don't get enough omega-3s from their diet. However, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of action for your specific needs. ‎<This message was edited>
[09/10/25, 9:24:36 PM] kisnan: @⁨Meta AI⁩ does it help in bulking
[09/10/25, 9:24:37 PM] Meta AI: Fish oil capsules can indirectly support muscle growth and bulking by:

1. Reducing inflammation: Omega-3s can help alleviate muscle soreness and inflammation, allowing for more intense workouts.
2. Improving joint health: Omega-3s may help reduce joint pain and inflammation, making it easier to perform exercises.
3. Supporting overall health: Omega-3s contribute to overall well-being, which is essential for muscle growth and recovery.

However, fish oil capsules are not a direct muscle-building supplement. For bulking, focus on:

1. Adequate protein intake
2. Caloric surplus
3. Resistance training
4. Sufficient rest and recovery

Consult a healthcare professional or certified trainer for personalized advice. ‎<This message was edited>

[22/10/25, 8:17:50 PM] Harshith Ashok: the only reason why she tolerates this much is cus you fuckers are my friends
[22/10/25, 8:18:12 PM] Harshith Ashok: kamalesh might also feel the same about you guys as well
[22/10/25, 8:18:30 PM] Harshith Ashok: no one in this group knows the difference between a joke and an insult
[22/10/25, 8:18:43 PM] kundan: wait how is kshama n pranav related to kamalesh not being able to talk to sanjana
[22/10/25, 8:18:46 PM] Harshith Ashok: and moreover why even talk about someone’s love interest

[22/10/25, 8:36:37 PM] anth: So it obviously gives a mental image about her
[22/10/25, 8:37:06 PM] anth: If shoth keeps ranting a 10p thousand times the resulting image of me on her will obviously be fucking bad
[22/10/25, 8:37:11 PM] thenkasi (vishnu): Machi he feels comfortable talking to you about his situation adhunaala pesuraan. Which is why he feels bad when nee adha vechae comment adicha. Not all things that you think of need to be said out loud la

[04/11/25, 6:41:08 PM] Harshith Ashok: ewe
[04/11/25, 6:41:09 PM] Meta AI: The full form of "FW" can vary depending on the context. Here are a few common interpretations:

- *FW: Forward*: Often used in messaging, email, or social media to ask someone to forward a message or content to others.
- *FW: FireWire*: A high-speed interface standard for connecting devices, commonly used in the tech industry.
- *FW: Firmware*: In technology, firmware is the software that controls the functionality of electronic devices.

If you provide more context, I can give you a more specific answer! ‎<This message was edited>
